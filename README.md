# Linux-Project
# Automated-backup-script-project
## Project Overview
This project provides a shell script for automating backups on Linux systems. The script uses tar to compress specified directories and files, then stores them in a designated backup directory. Itâ€™s designed to be scheduled using cron jobs, ensuring regular and reliable backups.

## Features
- Automated, scheduled backups of specific directories or files.
- Archive files are timestamped for easy organization.
- Optional encryption with GPG for secure backups.
- Logs output and errors for easy troubleshooting.
- Customizable retention policy to manage backup space.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Linux operating system
- Basic understanding of shell scripting
- tar and cron installed on the system (typically pre-installed)
- gpg for optional encryption

### Setup
1. *Clone the Repository*
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bholaa2002/Automated-backup-script-project.git
   cd Automated-backup-script-project
2. *Edit the Script*
Modify the paths in backup_prd.sh to reflect the directories you want to back up. By default, the script backs up a folder named scripts located on your desktop.
# Make the Script Executable
chmod +x /home/amit/backup_prd.sh
# Test the Script
Run the script manually to ensure it works as expected:
./backup_prd.sh
# Scheduling the Script with Cron
Open the cron configuration for your user:
crontab -e
Add a line to schedule the script (e.g., daily at 2 AM):
0 2 * * * /home/amit/backup_prd.sh >> /home/amit/backup_logs.txt 2>&1
# Script Configuration
The script includes configurable settings, such as:

Backup Source: Directory or files you want to back up.
Backup Destination: Where the backup files will be stored.
Encryption (optional): Enable or disable GPG encryption for sensitive backups.
# Security Considerations
Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access.
Use encryption (gpg) to protect sensitive data.
Limit sudo access by configuring /etc/sudoers as needed.
# Troubleshooting
Permission Denied: Ensure the script and backup directories have the correct permissions (chmod 700 for restricted access).
Cannot Resolve Host: Check your internet connection or DNS settings.
Failed Cron Jobs: Review backup_logs.txt for errors or adjust the cron schedule.
# Example Commands
*Manual Backup Execution*
./backup_prd.sh
*Encrypting a Backup*
For sensitive backups, use GPG encryption:
tar czf - /path/to/backup | gpg -c -o /path/to/encrypted_backup.tar.gz.gpg
# Future Enhancements
Cloud storage integration for remote backups.
Automated integrity checks for backup verification.
Configurable retention policy for automatic cleanup of older backups.
